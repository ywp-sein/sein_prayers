# Discernment and Faithfulness

Last weekend, I had the opportunity to share my testimonies and the project that God has placed on my heart. During the 17th weekly prayer, I asked God to teach me how to speak — and He answered that prayer. I was given the chance to share with people from different churches.


This is my 22th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for teaching me how to pray according to Your will, so that I can deeply experience Your grace and faithfulness. In that moment, I didn’t know clearly what I was going to say, but I vividly remember Your promise: “Open your mouth, and I will fill it.” And You did. Thank You also for the boldness You gave me, so that I could share my hope in You.


Lord, I also pray for discernment — to know who to work and collaborate with. Not everyone who seems helpful truly is; sometimes it costs more to work with someone whose heart is not sincere, even if their appearance is appealing. Please help me draw the line in the sand and stick to it — according to Your standard, not mine. Teach me how to say no when it is necessary, and help me to focus not on what is seen, but to obey You through the faith You have given me and will continue to increase.


Continue to teach me how to speak and express myself, and at the same time, remind me in my heart that it is not about being worthy, skillful, or knowledgeable in human eyes, but about being faithful to the only worthy One. Burn this same truth into the hearts of those I work with closely now and in the future, for without You, we cannot accomplish anything good.


Teach us, Lord, and keep us abiding in You always.


In Jesus’ mighty and precious name I pray,

Amen
