# 02 Learning to Number My Days Between Calling and Rest

I had several fruitful conversations in the past days—some of them were unexpected. Not only with people who work in related fields, but also with those who carry unique ideas and offer opportunities to collaborate and speak with experienced individuals from the US who have critical and sharp social insight.

This is the second weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for bringing us together so that we can talk about Your kingdom, exchange ideas, and know each other deeply.

I am excited that there are many promising and blessed projects going on in parallel. I would like to ask You once again to teach me how to manage my time and know what the priority of my life is in every moment. May You teach me to number my days so that I may gain a heart of wisdom.

In the meantime, please teach me how to rest as well. My body is Your temple; I have a duty to take care of it. In the past, I did a terrible job, but I know You do care for me in every aspect. So Lord, please strengthen and equip me so that I can do more for You, and enter Your rest and have a peaceful heart all the time.

Thank You for giving me the power to be obedient, and therefore You have promised that my house will never lack a person who stands before You. Thank You for the great blessing. I must perform my vows to You, O Lord; I will render thank offerings to You.

Thank You for loving me so much.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
