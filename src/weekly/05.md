# 05 Dependency upon God Alone

Praise the Lord! A person said yes to be my future employee. Thank God that He "lent" me His faithful servant to help me :)

This is the fifth weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for bringing us together to pray and wait upon You to show us this path. I don’t have much money right now, but You will provide. You have shown me many, many times that verse in Psalm 67—even now. I also want to say it out loud: Then shall the earth yield her increase; And God, even our own God, shall bless us!

Thank You for giving us this vision—that we have to discharge or break the dams and let the blessings go through the land. And thank You for the privilege that we can also build the canals to redirect the blessings to the needs.

Lord, I pray for wisdom for us to discern, and to depend on You only for such a time. And I pray that we will only be motivated by Your holy love. May we focus on Your Word—and You are the Word.

Your law is perfect, reviving the soul;<br>
Your testimony is sure, making wise the simple;<br>
Your precepts are right, rejoicing the heart;<br>
Your commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes;<br>
The fear of You is clean, enduring forever;<br>
Your rules are true, and righteous altogether.

May the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in Your sight. All glory to You, our Rock and our Redeemer.

In Jesus' name I pray and receive,

Amen.
