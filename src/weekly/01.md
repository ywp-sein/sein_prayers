# 01 Planted, Protected, and Proclaiming His Glory
Yesterday, a sister I met at the retreat asked how I was. I shared this vision with her, and she asked when I would post my next prayer. That’s when I thought—it would be wonderful to post a weekly prayer, so that in the future, people can testify to how great our God is.

This is the first weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for inspiring me to post weekly prayers through my sister. May You strengthen relationships in Your church. May we be excited to see Your wonder.

I know the devils are unhappy about this project, but You have given us Your authority to trample on them and overcome all the power of the enemy. I know nothing will harm me, because I know my name is written on Your hand. Therefore, I ask for protection for everyone who will be involved and connected to this project. And I declare that any demonic forces no longer have the power to influence this project.

May I live on Your provision only, trust in You, and have confidence in You. Then I will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. I will not fear when heat comes; my leaves will always be green. I won't have worries in a year of drought and will never fail to bear fruit.

May I glorify You with my entire life, and praise You forever and ever.
Thank You for loving me so much.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
