# Transformation in Health and Society

This week I caught the flu, which made me reflect again on the healthcare system in Germany. I don’t think setting a strict threshold for transitioning from public to private insurance is a good idea. The public healthcare system is already overloaded, while there is still capacity in the private sector. On another note, I also had fruitful conversations with people from different cities who share an interest in addressing homelessness.

This is my 18th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,


Thank You for bringing me into a field I never imagined, and for using my personal experiences to give me compassion for those who are sick and in need of health resources. Thank You for showing me that there are deep, systematic problems that need to be solved. Please guide me in understanding how to approach this complex puzzle, and bring the right people alongside me—those who also carry the heart to transform the system.

Thank You, Lord, not only for the vision on the social system side, but also for leading me step by step into a new chapter on the business side. You are showing me how to raise funding and develop business plans. Please give me a heart that seeks not income for its own sake, but instead looks for how the environment and market respond. I especially pray for wisdom in raising public awareness about these very issues.

Lord, please restore humanity within people. Soften hardened hearts and remove the numbness and selfishness that pervades society. Teach us to have compassion for one another. May we be fruitful and multiply, both physically and spiritually through You, in order to fulfill the very first task You entrusted to humanity.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
