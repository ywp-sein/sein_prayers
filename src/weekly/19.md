# Anointed to Contribute

This week I put some thoughts into a structural proof-of-concept plan, and several brothers and sisters gave me thoughtful and practical feedback that will help me improve further. Once again, God has revealed to me the importance of humanity, reminding me that selfishness has no place in a healthy society.


This is the 19th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,


Thank You for helping me to step forward. I remember that You prepared me long ago to brainstorm and write plans. Since my bachelor’s studies, I have written plans for student club events and records, camp programs, and even in my very first job after graduation, I created a thorough plan for an organization, including operations and budget. You have prepared me precisely for everything. Although that job was the most boring period of my life, now I can see the fruits.


I also want to thank You for stopping me from obtaining German citizenship before I understood the mindset of contributing back to society. I cannot merely take advantage of this place for my own convenience and give nothing in return. This is the same lesson for homeless people and for all of us—to contribute to the place where we live.


Lord, I want to pray as A.W. Tozer prayed: I ask You to sharpen my mind and enable me to receive everything You want to say to me. I ask You to anoint my head with the oil of the prophet so that I may speak Your truth to the people—for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort.


I know this will not be an easy path, but by Your grace, I have learned the secret of how to rejoice always.


I rejoice for who You are.


In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,


Amen.
