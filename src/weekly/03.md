# 03 Walking Through Open Doors with Radical Obedience

I’m grateful for the conversation earlier today with a sister in Christ from the other side of the earth. I was especially touched by a phrase she shared—“radical obedience.” It stirred something deep in me.

Thank you for your encouragement—see you soon this summer. :)

This is the third weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the more fruitful conversations I had in the past week, and for the opportunity to speak with them. As You’ve shown me before, a series of doors are now being opened before me.

May I walk in radical obedience—or even something crazier still—that I would obey You not just in words or intentions, but in concrete actions. Because You are the One I trust, and I will continue to trust You with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength. Help me to step through the doors You open with courage and clarity, without hesitation or turning back. Keep my heart tender to Your voice and my spirit attentive to Your leading. Let Your wisdom guide my every step, and may Your grace sustain me in each moment.

I especially thank You for the chance to witness and speak with those who serve the homeless on the front lines. Please grant me the wisdom to act as I should—to observe, to listen, to record the issues faithfully, and to analyze the situations with care so that things may be improved in the future. May all of this be motivated by Your love, and only by Your love. May we rely on Your grace alone, and may the hearts of these people be opened by You, that seeds might be planted tomorrow.

Give us expectant hearts, eager to witness the growth of the mustard seed—small now, but soon to become something abundant and full of life.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
