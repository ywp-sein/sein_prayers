# 09 Pray for People's Salvation

I have had fruitful conversations over the past days, not only with believers but also with non-believers. These moments remind me once again of the urgent need to pray for people’s salvation.

This is the ninth weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the divine reminder that we must urgently pray for people’s salvation. At the same time, help us take our faith seriously—taking every thought captive, examining and testing ourselves to see whether we are truly in the faith. May Christ Jesus be in us at every moment. If not, Lord, I ask for Your mercy—please burn away our doubts, so that we may look straight into Your eyes and not be distracted. Remove any numbness and apathy in our hearts when we see the lost; give us Your heart and Your mind for those who do not yet know You. 

I want to lift up before You the ministry in Pakistan that one of my prayer groups is supporting. Their sewing skills center for women has been asked to vacate its location. Lord, I ask that You open a new door for them and give them clear direction and instruction to overcome this difficult time by Your grace. 

As I pray for them, I also thank You for inspiring me with the vision to open a job training center and begin brainstorming possible job opportunities for homeless people—so that they may have their own “fishing rods” to fish for themselves. 

Thank You also for the clear instruction to make this ministry more public, and for reminding me to set the SEO settings on the website by the end of August. 

Finally, Lord, I once again lift up the people in my heart. May they not quench or grieve the Holy Spirit. Please open their hearts and minds to receive You as their Lord and Savior, and may they be baptized with Your Spirit and with fire. Please, Lord, bring back Your prodigal sons and daughters with Your holy love. Let them know that there is no shame in repentance—only Your deep and unending love.

Your will shall be done for sure.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
