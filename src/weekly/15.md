# Forget About Deadlines

This week, I was several times placed in situations where I had to reflect more on the way humans usually act—or how my old self tended to act. I’m thankful that early this morning, a brother in Christ blessed me with a prayer: that I can bring my questions before God, and that He may even resurrect the thoughts I once had in the past.

This is my 15th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,


Thank You for this past week, for bringing me to the limit where I really have to think about my thoughts, and for helping me renew my mind — both in the surprise of joy and in the reflection that comes with pain.


Thank You for bringing the concept of time back to my attention. Especially about deadlines. I searched my memory and even checked with ChatGPT, and it seems that no biblical figure ever prayed, “God, by [exact date] I want to do this for You.” Some acted under timeframes You gave, others made conditional vows without dates, and some set practical timelines after prayer.


The truth is, all timeframes come from You. If I pursue You fervently and faithfully, without distractions, I don’t really need to set deadlines myself, because I walk together with You. Deadlines are only for people who are passive and need to push themselves forward. But You don’t delight in lukewarm or passive hearts. So please help me to do everything in Your timing, and remind me continually that You also care about my rest.


Lord, the next question I want to bring to You is how to shorten — or even remove, if possible — the gap between thoughts and practice. I long for integrity. Please teach me and help me. Give me discernment so that in every situation I face, I always follow Your instructions, Your timing, and be moved by Your grace-filled love. May I really believe that I can discover truth by grace, and confirm grace through truth.

Thank You for all the emotions You give me, and please give us hearts after Your own heart.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
