# Strength to Rejoice, Courage to Act

This week, I was available to say “yes” to some help, and I experienced healing from the Lord regarding my childhood. As a child, I didn’t have to be independent, because I was just a child. The Father told me that He was there from the beginning, so I didn’t need to be harsh on myself or feel like I had to be independent. The truth is, I never have to be independent—I am called to be dependent on my Heavenly Father.

This is my 16th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,


Thank You, Lord, for the unexpected healing last week. I am grateful that You let me experience this healing before witnessing the tragedy of a brother in Christ, so that I may know with certainty that You will comfort those who mourn. Please give us vision to see beyond the brokenness, to recognize the hope within it, and to grasp it firmly and hold onto it. Lord, in every dark moment when the darkness feels overwhelming, let Your overwhelming love surpass it.

I have been reflecting on Your Word that says, “Rejoice always.” This makes me believe it is possible to rejoice even in sorrow. And in the following verses, You answer, “Pray without ceasing, and give thanks in all circumstances”—for this is Your will. So Lord, please help me to pray about everything. Teach me to bring all things before You, and continue to guide me to pray according to Your will.

Teach me and shape me to seek first Your kingdom and Your righteousness. Help me never to lose heart—in pain, in tears, in disappointment, or even in sickness. And please help me never to ignore injustice, especially corruption and broken systems that need to be changed. Give me all that I need if You are calling me to take part in that change, and help me step forward not with fear, but with love.

May Your will be done.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
