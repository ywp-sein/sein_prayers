# 12 Forget About the Money
Last weekend I met a friend with whom I’ve had many conversations about homeless people. As we talked, I remembered a discussion we had months ago, when we said that not every homeless person truly needs money. Back then, we came up with this “solution”: if I don’t bring my wallet, I don’t have to face the question of whether to give or not. At the time, I thought it was a clever idea.

But now I see it differently. That “solution” was actually just an excuse—something that allowed me to avoid the moment of discernment in each encounter. By doing that, I was also closing myself off from the chance to bless others with what I do have, whether that’s money, attention, or something else.

In truth, it was the behavior of burying the talent in the ground—ignoring the call to discern each situation and, in doing so, missing the opportunity to grow and to learn.

This is my 12th weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,
Thank You for revealing these truths to me and for teaching me so much about generosity recently. You have reshaped my understanding of money, showing me that I should not measure things by money alone, but by true purpose and value. Money is only one of the many blessings You allow to circulate in the world; I should not be blocked by the numbers themselves. Accumulating material things can hinder the flow of Your blessings, but blessings are meant to run through people and water the earth.

Thank You for teaching me that the purpose of saving is not mere accumulation or “just in case.” True saving is preparation for times of famine or shortage, for specific use at the specific time, just as Joseph did before the famine.

Lord, help me to forget about numbers and instead rely on Your grace—both what You have given me and what You will provide. Teach me to take every thought captive and discern clearly why I use my resources before deciding how to use them. Money is merely a tool to help others, and You are the source of every provision that can bless people through me.

Help me to abandon all measurements of material things—neither quantity nor quality—and instead become a vessel through which Your blessings flow freely. All I truly need is You, and I trust that You will provide everything I truly need.

Thank You for loving me so deeply. Please continue to shape me so that I may be a channel of blessing to others.

Finally, thank You for letting me know that I am so rich in You—far more than a billionaire.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,
Amen.
