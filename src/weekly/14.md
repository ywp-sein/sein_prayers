# 14 Encouragement from Every Nation

In the past week, I have unexpectedly met more people and received many lessons about leadership through them. I feel so encouraged, and they come from different nations. Now I’ve already spoken with people from every continent in a short time! :)

This is my 14th weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the lesson about leadership, and for using different people to speak to me. Thank You for showing me that one of the most important qualities of a leader is maintaining humanity in that position—not with fakeness, but with sincerity. Not by escaping, but by moving forward. Nowadays there are many lies about our emotions, and even attempts to numb us from feeling, so that we might escape true reality. Thank You for breaking those lies and revealing the truth.

Thank You for guiding me through all of this in the past, and for giving me clear goals to move forward. Yes, Father, I want to be a leader, and I will be a leader. I say “yes” to You now with clearer determination than before. I believe this is the path You want me to walk. All the talents and gifts You have given me, and will give me, I will use only for You. Lord, help me not to compromise in this—even in the small things that people might ignore. Help me not to give in at all. Build me and train me in the smallest things, so that through You I may be able to handle greater things in the near future.

Thank You for teaching me that a leader protects his or her people, not sacrifices them. With You, this is surely possible. Thank You, Lord, that You have given me a list of people I can work with. Please give me the wisdom to step forward, to begin recruiting, and to ask them to pray about the things You have placed in their hearts.


I trust You. And I trust that I trust You.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
