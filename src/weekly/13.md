# 13 No Grey Zone in You

In the past few weeks, I’ve explored the topic of judgment in several Bible studies, especially in 1 Corinthians. These times have led to some really practical and insightful conversations. I’ve come to see that we are always discerning between what is true and what is false—and that very act is a form of judgment. The real question, then, is not whether we judge, but how we judge: do we measure by God’s standard or by our own? To deny that we judge is both self-deceptive and an evasion of responsibility. It blinds us to truth, robs us of wisdom, and dulls our spiritual vision instead of sharpening it.

This is my 13th weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Teach me to continue to discern with Your wisdom; teach me to continue to judge in Your standard. In the position You want me to stand, help me to stand firm and ignore the judgments that are not from You. Keep me in a gentle and lowly state, because I want this continuity: to seek a deeper understanding of You, to listen to Your voice clearer, and to enter into deeper peace in You.


Thank You for teaching me that there is no grey zone in You. There is only One Truth. Light is light, darkness is darkness. True is true, false is false. I don’t need to be double-minded in my life. I believe every intention or motivation not for You is false, because everything is created through You and for You. Help me to do everything in love and glorify You only.


Lord, I pray that I may have the love, endurance, and patience from You to sacrifice for love and bear fruit, even when others disagree. Continue to forge me and make me even smaller, so that I may see clearly that You are doing mighty things.


Father, thank You for convincing me that You have taught me and sustained me to keep myself in Your love, and never leave You. I will remain in Your presence and pour out my heart and all my question marks before You, to know my Creator more and more. And this will be my entire life.


In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
