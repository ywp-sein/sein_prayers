# Prepared Hearts and Faithful Steps

Last weekend, I found myself recalling several conversations and finally having deeper talks with people I hadn’t connected with in that way before. Then, as I was praying, this idea suddenly came to me.


This is the 20th weekly prayer:


Dear Heavenly Father,


Thank You for this idea. So many things are now coming together for good, and it’s amazing to see how You orchestrate everything. It’s wild at times, but I love it. Even now, I sense there are small pieces that You will use mightily in the future — and I deeply appreciate that.


Thank You for not letting me compromise. I pray that only those who, like the ones in the story of Gideon, lapped the water with their hands, will join this work. Father, I ask that only those whom You have chosen to go with me will walk with me — and I trust that You will show me who they are.


Lord, I pray for people to say “yes” to You — and to remain faithful to that “yes.” Thank You in advance for these people. Please prepare their hearts, and mine as well, to wait upon You — just as the disciples waited together in unity in the upper room before Your Spirit came. And when You speak, may we move in obedience to what You show us to do.


Lord, I ask for that same unity, and for the boldness to stand firm in what You reveal — always with the motivation of love.


In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,


Amen.
