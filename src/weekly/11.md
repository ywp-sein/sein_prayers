# 11 Endurance, Guidance, and Generous Faith

Recently, I unexpectedly encountered many faithful ministers. They risk their lives to reach unreached places, tribes, and even countries under persecution. Their stories have greatly encouraged me and reminded me once again of the blessing of remaining uncompromised.

This is my 11th weekly prayer:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank You for the encounters that have encouraged me so deeply. Thank You for letting me see the trajectory of Your grace. I know You are preparing something great and new for me. I can hardly imagine all these connections across the world. This is the hope You continue to grow in me—the hope of a global church founded only on You. Not to entertain people, not to compromise with cultures or modern agendas, not to feed self-ambition.

Thank You for impressing on my heart that if anyone uses a definition that does not come from the Bible to interpret the Bible, they will be misled and distort the truth—because the starting point is already wrong. You alone are the starting point. We must deny ourselves and follow You. And it is Your Holy Spirit who helps us understand Your Word, for without abiding in You, we can do nothing.

Thank You for making it so clear that:
there are curses for those who compromise, and blessings for those who endure. And the blessings for those who endure are far greater than anything this world could offer or imagine.

Indeed, this is why I endure and am able to endure. Even more, You have granted me blessings I never imagined. Thank You for teaching me to care not about the number, but about the heart to give. This is such a precious lesson from You, and I know You will bless me more because I already know how to trust You and give. Thank You for all the opportunities You have given me—and will continue to give me—to give.

With You, my mighty God, all things are possible. You are my great Counselor and Provider, and in You, the word “budget” almost seems funny—because You supply all I truly need.

Thank You for teaching me to become more and more like You. I love You.

In Jesus’ name I pray and receive,

Amen.
