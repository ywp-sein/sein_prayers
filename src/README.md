**Anchored in Love, Led by the Spirit, for the Glory of God**

This is the first mail that I sent to myself. And this is my prayer:

May God guide me step by step and humble me, give me the wisdom to do everything in love, to really show that love is a decision — not about feeling. And to tell myself once again why I initiated this: it is because my Heavenly Father first loved me.

May I continue to have the pure heart, so I can seek my Lord and Savior always. And may the Holy Spirit that moved me continue to move me, and let there be a double portion on all the people that will be involved and connected to this ministry.

>Our Father, who art in heaven,<br>
>Hallowed be Thy name.<br>
>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,<br>
>as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<br>
>For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever.<br>
>Amen.
